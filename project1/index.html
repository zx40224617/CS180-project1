      <p class="introduction">
        Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky, a Russian chemist and photographer,
        travelled around the whole Russian Empire under the permission of Tzar
        to take color photographs of everything. But the point is, there was no
        such a technique at the time for printing color photographs. He came up
        with a relatively easy idea that he could take picture of very scene on
        a plate using red, green, blue filters to acheieve a colorful image. And
        the main idea of this project is that we are given a data of an image
        with rgb filters, and we need to implement the idea to get a colorful
        photograph.
