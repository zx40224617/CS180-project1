      <h2 class="title">Background of the project:</h2>
      <p class="introduction">
        Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky, a Russian chemist and photographer,
        travelled around the whole Russian Empire under the permission of Tzar
        to take color photographs of everything. But the point is, there was no
        such a technique at the time for printing color photographs. He came up
        with a relatively easy idea that he could take picture of very scene on
        a plate using red, green, blue filters to acheieve a colorful image. And
        the main idea of this project is that we are given a data of an image
        with rgb filters, and we need to implement the idea to get a colorful
        photograph.

      <h2 class="title">How do we do it:</h2>
      <h3>1. Process Image</h3>
      <p class="description">
        First and foremost, we need to read the images that are given to us. So
        we can print it out to see what can we do with it. In my application, I
        use matplotlib to read and show the image. And after reading the image,
        we can print out the image that we are given.
      </p>
      <image
        src="./images/cathedral_output.jpg"
        alt="original given picture of Cathedral.jpg"
      />
      <p class="description">
        Note that the filter from top to bottom are b, g, r. So now we need to
        slice the images into 3 different part so that we can stack them
        altogether. What we do here is simply divided the hieght of the original
        image by 3 and them use index slicing to get the coresspoind part.
      </p>

        <div class="imageList">
          <p class="description">blue filter:</p>
          <image
            src="./images/cathedral_output_b.jpg"
            alt="original given picture of Cathedral with blue flter.jpg"
            class="resultImage"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="imageList">
          <p class="description">green filter:</p>

            class="resultImage"
          />

        <div class="imageList">

            class="resultImage"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="description">
        And as you can see, there are some border around the images, which we
        need to get rid of them or they will influence out later calculation.
        Here I didn&#39;t implement anything special, but just crop all 4 sides
        of the image by a fixed percentage (10 % in my case) of the image.
      </p>
      <p class="description">cropped image with blue filter:</p>

        src="./images/cathedral_output_b_cropped.jpg"
        alt="original given picture of Cathedral.jpg with blue filter and cropped"
      />

      <p class="description">
        After we finished processing all the 3 channels images, we can now start
        with the next step
      </p>

      <h3 class="title">2. Brute Force Alignment:</h3>
      <p class="description">
        After we have pre-processed all of our images, we can noe tarting to
        implement the technique to produce color photograph. The problem is, we
        still need to align all the different channels before we can stack them.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        This is something you will get without any alignment:
      </p>
      <image
        src="./images/cathedral_output_no_alignment.jpg"
        alt="Picture of Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky"
      />

      <p class="description">
        So what we need to do is that choose a base channel out of 3 as a
        reference, and see how we can find the correct displacement of the other
        2 channels baseon the base channel so they can be well aligned. The
        esiest implementation is that we can go over a small window of search,
        like [-15, 15] in my case. And try find the best displacement
        exhuastively.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        How we check which one is the best displacement? The 2 naive ways are
        calculating the euclidean distacne or NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)
        between 2 images.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p class="description">Euclidean Distance:</p>
        <image
          src="./images/cathedral_output_euclidean_alignment.jpg"
          alt="Picture of Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky"
        />
        <p class="description">NCC:</p>
        <image
          src="./images/cathedral_output_NCC_alignment.jpg"
          alt="Picture of Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky"
        />
      </div>

      <h4>Summary:</h4>
      <p class="description">
        As we can see, NCC perform better than euclidean distance, this is
        because Euclidean ditance directly calculate the pixel intesity between
        2 images, which will be influenced a lot by brightness value. And NCC is
        less senstive to this issue, so NCC is more robust in this case.
      </p>

      <h4>Potential Problem:</h4>
      <p class="description">
        The naive algorithm we implemented works fine as we just see, but the
        problem is, what if we have a really large file with better solution of
        the image like .tif files? Then the search window of this kind of image
        may need to be [-100, 100] or even bigger. Which is not really
        applicable and is really slow, so we need to improve our algorithm.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title">3. Image Pyramid Alignment</h3>
      <p class="description">
        In order to deal with bigger image files, we can implement an algorithm
        called image pyramid. We first down sample the big image to a really
        small one. And then we do the brute force search in a small window like
        we did above. We then return the best displacement to the previous call
        (one step bigger image), and inherit the displacement, and do the the
        brute force search in a small window again. By repeating this process,
        we can save a lot of computation force and time.
      </p>

      />

      <h4>Some Notes:</h4>
      <ul class="questions">
        <li>
          Depends on how much we down sample the image each time, we need to
          adjust the inherited distance the same scale. Like in my application,
          I down sample the image by 1/2 each time, so the inherited distacnes
          need to times 2 when return to the previous call.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is better to implement this algorithm using recursion since you
          need to inherit the distance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everything wroks fine except for emir.tif. This is because I chose
          blue filter as my base filter in every case. But the blue shirt of
          Emir has has pixel value â‰ˆ 1 in the blue filter, which will mess up
          the calcuation in Euclidean and NCC. What we can do is that we can
          simply just choose another filter as the base image, or implement SSIM
          or edge detector. Unfortunately I have no extra time for that bell and
          whistle.
